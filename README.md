# Motion-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Detect motion in a video recorded or live both. </br>
</br>
First you have to install <b>OpenCV</b> using <b>pip</b> to run this code.</br>
</br>
Here I have used <b>OpenCV</b> with  python for detecting motion. I have also supplied a sample video to check but one can always
use webcam or any other  camera also by changing a little in the code.
